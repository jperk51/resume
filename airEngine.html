		<p class="desc">This engine was designed, built, and programmed, using Arduinos and Arduino C, by OSU's Mechanical Engineering Electronics Lab. It is a single-cylinder engine that runs on compressed air. Outside of the capstone course the lab
			would design, build, wire, and program electromechanical devices for research professors. The engine was used by M.E. capstone students to test code they had written for
			opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves. I worked on the single-cylider engine by getting it prepared to be used by the capstone students and by
			writing code that would run the engine at high RPMs. My code was used to show the students what kind of RPM was possible. We, the lab members, managed to get the engine to run about 3000 RPM
			with 80 PSI of compressed air. Towards the end of my time at the lab I taught the programming portion of the M.E. capstone. (Click images below to enlarge)</p>
